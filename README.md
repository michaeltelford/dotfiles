# Dotfiles

Quick setup of an awesome development environment on any *nix machine.

## Includes

- Bash customisations (aliases, functions, git prompt etc.)
- Homebrew (or Linuxbrew) packages
- Docker functionality
- Ruby interpreters (using `rbenv`) and gems
- Go lang setup ($GOPATH etc.)
- ...

## Dependancies

Note: The below dependancies won't be necessary if you're only installing the
dotfile symlinks.

OS X:
- xcode (`xcode-select --install` and follow prompt)

Linux (using the native package manager):
- git
- bash
- gawk
- curl
- ruby

## Usage

To install on your own machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/michaeltelford/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make install # or 'make dotfiles' for dotfile symlinks only.
```

Be sure to see the `make help` for what gets installed. Instead of installing
everything with `make install` you can choose individual components. For
example running `make dotfiles` will only install the symlinks e.g. .bashrc to
your home folder.

You may be prompted for input throughout the install process so keep an eye on it.

You will likely need to restart any existing shell sessions for changes to
take effect.

## Fork and Extend

Feel free to fork the repository and extend (or trim) it to your liking by:

- Add a new topic folder e.g. `python`.
- In it create an `install.sh` script which is executable.  This script will
be run automatically by `make install` or one of the topic make tasks.
- If you need a file symlinked from your topic folder to the home directory,
simply give it the extension `symlink` (see Extension Notes below).
- Any script placed in `./bin` will be added to `$PATH`.

Pull requests are also welcome but I can't guarantee I'll get round to looking
at them in a timely fashion.

### Extension Notes

#### ./**/install.sh

If you want to install a new homebrew package e.g. node then simply add it to
the `./homebrew/Brewfile`. Done. But if you then want additional configuration
e.g. to install npm packages once installed then you should also create a
topic directory (described in'Fork and Extend' above) which handles specific
configuration, in this case installing npm packages. The brew install always
completes before topic installers ensuring that any installed executables are
available as needed.

#### *.symlink

Any file following `./bash/*.symlink` will be symlinked to the home directory.
E.g. `.bashrc ~> ./bash/bashrc.symlink`.

#### ./dir

Any scripts in `./dir` will be added to `$PATH` making them available anywhere.
You can call the script by its name. This means that scripts should NOT have an
extension. For example `nuke` makes more sense than `nuke.rb` when typed into
the command line. Note that each script must have the executable permissions to
be called. E.g. `chmod +x nuke`. Note that it's generally better to put any
shell related functionality in the `bash/bash_functions.symlink` and keep
executable scripts in this directory for other technologies or uses.

#### Other

See `./install_helpers.sh` for useful methods which may make development
easier e.g. fancy print methods in keeping with existing formatting. Also
see `./Makefile` for install tasks.

The scripts are designed so that they can be safely executed multiple times
on the same environment if necessary. You should ensure that any new
functionality follows the same pattern when writing an `install.sh` script.

These dotfiles should be able to run on any *nix distro but is mainly meant
for Mac OS X machines. Provided is a `./Dockerfile` for testing new changes
on a debian machine.

The installer scripts are designed to fail on an error by default. If you
want to ignore such failures from a script or command then you should append
its command with ` || true`. For example, `source myscript.sh || true`.
This will mask any errors and allow the install process to continue.

## Thanks

Thanks must go to:

- Jess Frazelle's [docker](https://github.com/jessfraz) functionality.
- Zach Holman's [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) for the approach of easily extending a dotfile repository and some awesome code. Also see his cool [article](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) on dotfiles.
